### Hi there 👋 I am Pelumi Adebayo, a self-taught software developer with experience spanning the development and maintenance of software products. I have 3 years of experience building core web applications with C#. I came from a finance background because I studied Finance as a discipline. I later transitioned into the tech industry as a software engineer. What led me into this path was because I developed a passion for problem-solving which later led to starting my first publication on problem-solving titled Data Structure and Algorithm Basic: A Simple Introduction to problem-solving.
🌱 I’m currently learning better and optimized ways to solve problems and I share a bit of what I learn on my personal blog which you can find <a href="http://pswith.me">here</a>

I Consistently innovates to create value. I find opportunities where others see none: I turn ideas into
projects and projects into serial success
