### Hi there 👋 I am Pelumi Adebayo. I came from a finance background because I studied Finance as a discipline. I later transitioned into the tech industry as a software engineer. What led me into this path was because, I developed a passion for problem solving which later led to my first publication on LinkedIn titled Data Structure and Algorith Basic: A Simple Introduction to problem solving.
🌱 I’m currently learning better and optimized way to solve problem and I share a bit of what i learn on my personal blog which you can find <a href="http://pswith.me">here</a>
